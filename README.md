# Mind Talk
## Summary
A LAN text chat messenger written in C++, MFC with client, server and an updater to roll out new versions automatically. It was written as part of my hobby project and used in a start-up to test and roll out locally on Windows 7 systems. It involves raw socket communication between clients and server lists all the connection details.

## Archiving
Originally written in 2011 and archived in 2017. While writing this readme in 2024, I recall about an installer written in NSIS scripting language which is lost but it was used to pack `./binary` folder as a windows installer.
